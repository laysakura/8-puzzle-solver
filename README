Usage:
        Executable files (Linux ELF) are already in this directory.

                   $ ./solv1
                   $ ./solv2

        Each command produce the solution of [2](i) and [2](ii).

Installation:
        To build these two files above, you need boost library.
        Just
                $ make
        produces 'solv', which is equals to 'solv1' above.
        To get 'solv2', modify 'Puzzle.cpp' to:

           l.11,12:     //calch1();
                        calch2();

           l50,51:      //calch1();
                        calch2();

Notes:
        This program uses 'tree.hh', which is an STL-like implement of tree data structure.
        Since library has GPL license, this program should also be publicshed under GPL.
